My take on the "rate movies + machine learning" app.

Currently a work in progress. Uses Express and MongoDB.

This app as of right now will let you randomly traverse the entire imDb movie library and log your ratings to a database. 

I'm learning a ton about API interaction over HTTP and debugging long promise chains.
